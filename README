Google Calendar Trends

This is a google apps script example created by Josh Calahan and Brian
Pittman at the Mtn View Apps Script Hackathon on September 23, 2010.

To try it out you'll need to create a Google Docs spreadsheet, go to tools,
and paste in the contents of calendarTrends.js by navigating to Tools > Script
Editor. Then go to Calendar Trends > Refresh and the script will populate
cells in the Data sheet of your spreadsheet with calendar trends data.

Once you have the data in the spreadsheet, you can easily create charts to
visualize it however you like.

Currently the script is hardcoded to pull in one year's worth of data from
your default calendar.
